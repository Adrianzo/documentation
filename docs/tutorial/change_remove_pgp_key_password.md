#Change or Remove password  
If you want to change your pgp secret key for your RetroShare node it's 
possible to do this with [GnuPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard).  

These instructions work for Linux.  

Before you edit your Keyring, copy the directory before editing to have a backup.  

    cp -r ~/.retroshare/pgp ~/.retroshare/pgp.orig

list secret keys to choose which one to edit and get the user-id  

```bash
    gpg --openpgp --homedir ~/.retroshare/pgp/ --keyring retroshare_public_keyring.gpg --secret-keyring retroshare_secret_keyring.gpg --list-secret-keys  
```

```bash
    alice@laptop:~$ gpg --openpgp --homedir ~/.retroshare/pgp/ --keyring retroshare_public_keyring.gpg --secret-keyring retroshare_secret_keyring.gpg --list-secret-keys
    gpg: WARNING: unsafe permissions on homedir `/home/alice/.retroshare/pgp/'
    gpg: keyring `/home/alice/.retroshare/pgp//secring.gpg' created
    gpg: keyring `/home/alice/.retroshare/pgp//pubring.gpg' created
    gpg: /home/alice/.retroshare/pgp//trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
    /home/alice/.retroshare/pgp//retroshare_secret_keyring.gpg

    uid                  Alice (Generated by RetroShare) <>
```

edit the key  

```bash
    gpg --openpgp --homedir ~/.retroshare/pgp/ --keyring retroshare_public_keyring.gpg --secret-keyring retroshare_secret_keyring.gpg --edit-key <<user-id>>

    gpg>passwd

    You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
    user: "username (Generated by RetroShare) <>"
    4096-bit RSA key, ID <<your-id>>, created 2016-10-1

    Enter the new passphrase for this secret key.

    Enter passphrase:

    Repeat passphrase:

    You don't want a passphrase - this is probably a *bad* idea!

    Do you really want to do this? (y/N) y

    gpg>quit
    Save changes? (y/N) y
```

if everything is ok you can delete the backup  

```bash
    rm -r ~/.retroshare/pgp.orig
```
